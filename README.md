<h1 id="pivpn-on-aws">PiVPN on AWS</h1>
<p>This guide will walk you through creating your own <a href="http://www.pivpn.io">PiVPN</a> server on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> and connecting to it from Windows. PiVPN was originally created to host your own VPN server on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">RaspberryPi</a>, but is portable to AWS as well.</p>
<p>Not only will this will help protect yourself from being monitored by your ISP, but also protect you from cybercriminals looking to steal your information.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Amazon Web Services offers one year of free virtual server space, provided you use less than predetermined amounts of bandwidth, time, and space. AWS free tier includes 750 EC2 hours a month. So if this is the only EC2 instance you create, you should not be billed. Even if you go over that limit, the cost of running a server image on Amazon‚Äôs Elastic Compute Cloud is probably less than you would pay for a VPN subscription.</p>
<p>List of things you‚Äôll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Amazon Web Services account. This requires a credit card, but you‚Äôll only be charged for what you use, which will likely be nothing if you‚Äôre prudent about what you‚Äôre doing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">PuTTy</a>. You‚Äôll also need PuTTy‚Äôs sister key generation program, PuttyGen.</li>
<li><a href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a>, or an equivalent FTP client to move files between your local computer and your EC2 instance.</li>
<li>A basic working knowledge of Unix commands and how servers work with clients will be massively helpful in troubleshooting should something not go exactly as planned.</li>
<li><a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html">OpenVPN GUI</a>, installed in the default location and with the default settings on your PC</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-aws">Setting up AWS</h2>
<p>Once you‚Äôve signed up for an Amazon Web Services account, here‚Äôs how to launch the server that we‚Äôll use for our VPN:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Log into your Amazon Web Service account and head to the EC2 dashboard. <img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_1.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the top right, you can choose the location where we‚Äôll be setting up your VPN. Then click Launch Instance. <img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_2.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose whatever Linux AMI is listed as ‚Äúfree tier eligible.‚Äù At the time of writing this article, I‚Äôm choosing <strong>Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS</strong>. Go on to the next step. <img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_3.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here choose a t2.micro instance that‚Äôs also free tier eligible. Click <strong>Review and Launch</strong>. <img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_4.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the next page, click <strong>Edit Security Groups</strong>. <img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_5.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You‚Äôll need to edit the security group to only allow traffic from your computer to access the VPN or proxy. You should have one rule already in place for connecting to your server via SSH, which we‚Äôll use later. We‚Äôll need to add another to allow OpenVPN connections, which use port 1194 by default. For simplicity‚Äôs sake, click the  <strong>Add rule</strong>  button. Set the  <strong>Type</strong>  to  <strong>Custom UDP</strong>, the <strong>Port Range</strong>  to <strong>1194</strong>, and the Source to  <strong>Anywhere</strong>. <img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_6.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Review and Launch</strong> <img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_7.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all went well, your page should look similar (your Source IP will be different) with the rules we just created in the ‚ÄúSecurity Groups‚Äù section. Now click <strong>Launch</strong> <img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_8.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you‚Äôll want to create a key pair, which sort of works like a password that you‚Äôll use to connect to the virtual server you‚Äôre creating. Select ‚Äú<strong>create a new key pair</strong>‚Äù from the dropdown menu and name it whatever you like. Click the button to download the key pair. Store it somewhere safe.<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_9.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next page should alert you that the instance is launching. Scroll to the bottom and hit <strong>View instances.</strong> Here you‚Äôll see a list of any instances you‚Äôve launched, which if this is your first time using EC2 will just be one.<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_10.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="connecting-to-the-server-with-putty">Connecting to the server with PuTTy</h2>
<p>We can connect to our EC2 instance with PuTTy, but first we‚Äôll need a proper key file to get connected. When you installed PuTTy, you should have also installed PuTTygen. Go ahead and run it now. PuTTy and PuTTygen both run right out of the box as .exe files with no need to install.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open PuTTygen, click <strong>Load</strong>.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_11.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the .pem key pair file you downloaded before and load it into Puttygen. You‚Äôll have to select the option to show all file types for the .pem key to show up. Hit <strong>Save Private Key</strong>. The file name must be identical to the .pem key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now close out of PuTTygen and open PuTTy. Copy your instance‚Äôs public IP from the EC2 console into PuTTy. Type in a name for your session and hit save.<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_12.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the left pane, navigate to <strong>Auth</strong> under SSH. Click the browse button at the bottom and navigate to the private key you just generated.<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_13.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back on the main Session page, name and save your session profile so you can quickly connect the next time you use PuTTy. Then click <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A prompt will appear asking you for a username. For the Amazon Ubuntu AMI, it‚Äôs <code>ubuntu</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="setup-openvpn-on-the-server">Setup OpenVPN on the server</h2>
<p>OpenVPN is a free open source tool that will let you run a full-on VPN through your Amazon EC2 instance. That means all your internet traffic goes through it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Connect to your EC2 instance using PuTTy according to the instructions above. Once logged in, update and install the packages on the server:<br>
<code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade -y</code><br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_14.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start the PiVPN installer:<br>
<code>curl -L [https://install.pivpn.io](https://install.pivpn.io/) | bash</code><br>
For more detail on this, see <a href="http://www.pivpn.io/#tech">http://www.pivpn.io/#tech</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You are then guided through the process of installing all the required software and configuring the VPN server:<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_15.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_16.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_17.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_18.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>Choose the default ubuntu user.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_19.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>We do want to enable unattended upgrades of security patches.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_20.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>Choose UDP as the protocol to use.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_21.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>Choose the default port 1194.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_22.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_23.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>Create a 2048 bit encryption key.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_24.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_25.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>Choose to use your servers public IP address.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_26.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>Choose whichever DNS provider you would like to use. I chose Google.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_27.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>Installation is now complete üôÇ<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_28.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>Choose to reboot the server.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_29.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_30.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>Once the server has rebooted, checking the AWS dashboard for it‚Äôs status, SSH back in to the server.</p>
<p>Now we need to configure a VPN profile that we can use to connect to the VPN server.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to use the ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãpivpn command line utility:<br>
<code>pivpn add</code><br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_31.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>This will guide you through the process of creating a profile. Make sure to use a strong password and note both the profile name and the password as you will need these later.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_32.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<p>Set up is now complete so you can logout.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_33.png" alt="EC2"></p>
<h2 id="download-vpn-configuration-files-for-use-locally">Download VPN configuration files for use locally</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To get the files off of our server and onto our PC, we‚Äôll use a free program called WinSCP. Just use the default installation options. Once that‚Äôs done, a window should pop up prompting you to import your server authentication details from PuTTy. Select the one we made above and continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select myvpn (or whatever you named yours) and hit the Edit button. Type in <strong>ubuntu</strong> under user name. Click on Login.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_34.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this isn‚Äôt your first time using WinSCP, you can set the .ppk file you used in PuTTy by clicking <strong>Edit</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong>. Go to <strong>SSH &gt; Authentication &gt; Private key file</strong> and navigate to your PPK file.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ctomford/PiVPN-AWS/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot_35.png" alt="EC2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the host name field on the main page, you can enter either the IP address or domain of your EC2 instance. Be sure to save your settings, then hit <strong>Login</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the right pane, navigate to the directory containing your key files, in this case <strong>/home/ubuntu/ovpns</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlight your file {username.ovpn} and click the download button or drag the file from the right pane to the left pane. This will download the .ovpn file to your current directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once downloaded you can import this to your <a href="https://openvpn.net/client-connect-vpn-for-windows/">OpenVPN client software for Windows</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optionally) You can install the client on your Android phone through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn&amp;hl=en_US">GooglePlay</a>, download and import this file to your Android phone and have a VPN on your phone as well.</p>
</li>
